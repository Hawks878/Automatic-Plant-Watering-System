# Automatic Plant Watering System 

PROCEDURE: The procedure of this project went as follows. First we did a cable swap, so that the pins we were connecting too would work properly. Then we connected the moisture sensor with that cable to the A0 port on the board. Next we got the MOSFET set up by connecting a male and female jack to positive and negative terminals. Then that MOSFET was connected to the board through the D2 port. Now we can connect the battery to the IN side of the MOSFET and the pump to the OUT side through the jack connections. As well as lastly connecting the plastic tubing on the barbed side of the pump. With our watering set up now put together, all that was left to do was to program it. We had our voltage values from a previous lab that we could use to set variables and instructions to them. If, elseif, and then statements were used so the board could tell when to water the plant and when to stop.
